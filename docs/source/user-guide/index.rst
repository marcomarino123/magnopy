Magnopy is a python library and to get the most of it one need to use it as one.
Nevertheless, we do not want to limit it accessability only to users who is familiar
with python. For that purpose we introduced a number of the scripts that perform
calculation with magnopy and can be executed as any other command line tool. Please visit
the one of the guides from above to read more about each script.

Full tutorials about magnopy are hosted on a separate web-site. Please visit
|magnopy-tutorials|_ to go through the tutorials that were given about the code.

In the pages above we provide simple guides on how to achieve a small well-define task
within magnopy. Those "How to ..." guides are written based on the questions that users
are asking about the code. If you do not see the how-to guide that answers your question,
please do not hesitate to ask it via our :ref:`support` channels.
